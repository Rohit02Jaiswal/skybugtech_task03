Password Generator : 


A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords 
for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, 
allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.

It is fully GUI based. For GUI I have used Tkinter module.

It will prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password and based on length it will generate random password.
